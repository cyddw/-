## LLM4CP: Adapting Large Language Models for Channel Prediction
Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technology is regarded as a core technology in the fifth-generation
(5G) and beyond 5G mobile communication systems for enhancing the spectral efficiency（SE）. Accurate channel 
state information (CSI) plays a fundamental role in facilitating m-MIMO related design, such as transceiver 
optimization, adaptive modulation, resource allocation, and so on.
